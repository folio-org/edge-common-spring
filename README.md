## Introduction

This is a shared library/framework for edge APIs for spring way modules.
This module is a port of [edge-common](https://github.com/folio-org/edge-common), and main goal is feature parity with that framework. 
From a hosting/SysOps perspective, edge modules developed with this framework should be indistinguishable from those developed using edge-common.

## Overview
The intent of edge-common-spring is to simplify the implementation of edge APIs by providing much of the boilerplate code shared among these APIs.

### How to use this framework
All spring way edge modules, that will use this library, should add it as a dependency. 
After that, all requests that will call the edge module will go through the request filter from the library. 
As a result, incoming request will contain ***x-okapi-token*** in the header, and the edge module will be able to invoke folio modules.

By default, filter will make authorization and receive the ***x-okapi-token*** header only if the requested URL does not start with: /admin/health, admin/info, /_/tenant, /_/proxy.
The array of endpoints that need to be excluded can be overriden, for example:
 -D***header.edge.validation.exclude***="/firstRequiredEndpointToExclude, /secondRequiredEndpointToExclude".
