## Introduction

This is a shared library/framework for edge APIs for spring way modules.
This module is a port of [edge-common](https://github.com/folio-org/edge-common), and main goal is feature parity with that framework. 
Edge modules should be indistinguishable from a hosting/SysOps perspective.

## Overview
The intent of edge-common-spring is to simplify the implementation of edge APIs by providing much of the boilerplate code shared among these APIs.
